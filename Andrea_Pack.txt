You walk out of the plane and step into the daylight sun. You look down at the runway you just landed on. You step down the airplane steps and take your pilot hat off. You breathe out heavily and think about the successful flight you just had. Now that you finished your flight for the day, you can go back home and relax before you leave for New York tomorrow./You unlock your car and get in the drivers seat. You turn on your engine and begin your drive home./Right as you turn on your radio you hear: "This is an EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION from the Center for Disease Control. As of this moment, the health crisis in the United States has spread to unsafe levels and a COMPLETE EVACUATION has been ordered. Be cautious of your surroundings and be safe. Avoid contact with others that have been affected. Please evacuate to the Staples Center as we have contained the area and will be flying survivors to safer locations."/ The message ends and you are stopped at a red light confused on what just happened. You look outside of your window and see a lady running rapidly. You look behind her and see that someone is chasing her./*BOOM*/You quickly turn to the front of your car and see a man who slammed his hand on your hood./"They are coming!! Get out of here!"/He gets tackled by another person. The light turns green./Choice 1: Check on the guy/Choice 2: Drive away/~
You open your car door and quickly get out to see if the man is okay. When you look you see that there is blood everywhere and the man who tackled him is chewing at his skin. You freak out and grab your car door to get back in. When you are safe inside your car, you prepare to put your car into drive and suddenly see something close through the side of your eye. You look over and see a man sitting in your passenger seat./"Get out of the car!"/Choice 1: Get out/Choice 2: Fight him/~
You slam your foot on the gas and speed off. You know that the town is going crazy so you know you have to get to safety./As you are driving to the Staples Center, there is a road block full of cars. You come to a stop and look around to see what has happened. There are bodies on the floor, blood plastered on the side of cars. It looks like a war zone./As you keep looking you finally see someone. The person is crawling and seems like they are struggling./Choice 1: Check on the person/Choice 2: Get out of there/~
You look at the man and rapidly get out of the car. You see him get into the drivers seat and begin to drive off. You yell out of frustration./As you are yelling, you catch your mouth and remember the man on the floor. The monster on top of him turns to you and licks its lips. You freak out and begin to run in the other direction. You can hear the monster chase after as it grunts and makes weird noises. You are giving it everything you have and it isn't good enough. You hear a scream behind you and next thing you know, you're getting tackled by the monster. Your face hits the cement and suddenly feel a sharp pain in your back./The zombie caught up to you because you were too slow.#/~
You punch the man in the face and push him against the passenger door. He grabs his face and begins to surrender./"Jesus you hit hard", the man says./You yell at him to get out and continue to shove him. The man grabs the car handle and falls out of the car as you push him out. You jump over to close the door and lock the car. You put the car in drive and speed off./After speeding to the Staples Center, you get there within 10 minutes./You park your car close to the center in the big parking lot. Before you exit your car to make a break to the front door, you remember that you have a switch blade in your car compartment. You rapidly reach over and grab it out./You have the weapon in your hand and grab your door handle./Choice 1: Look around before making a run/Choice 2: Run out of the car to safety/~
You put your car in park and grab your door handle. You exit out of your car./"Hello", you call out to the person./"Please help me please! My leg is broken!"/ You see the person look up to you and continue to crawl over. You walk slowly up to them while making sure you keep your distance./"What happened here?", you ask./"There was all kinds of them that attacked people's cars. I don't know what they are, but they are contagious some how. They were turning people."/"How do I know that you aren't turned?", you ask./"When I saw other cars getting attacked I sped off but rammed into a car. I woke up to all this wreckage and no idea how I survived any of this. But I am not affected. When you get bit you turn right away. That's what happened to all the people I saw."/"Okay, I'll help you but we have to hurry!", you say./You walk up the person and see that they look healthy, except their leg. It's broken pretty bad. You help the lady up and begin to walk back to the car./You both are close to the door when suddenly you hear a scream from the wreckage. You both turn around and see a person walk around the cars and continue to growl./"Oh no, that's one of them./"Let's hurry we can make it to the car", you say./"No, leave me behind. Get to safety!"/You feel the woman push you away with the strength she has and begin to taunt the zombie over./You run to your car door and get in. You grab the car keys and turn the engine on. You look over at the woman once more and see that the zombie got to her. You look away and drive off./After driving and crying for ten minutes you find yourself getting close to the center. You know that the center is 3 minutes away. You step on your gas pedal out of excitement./ Instead of your car speeding up it begins to slow down. You look down to see that you are out of gas. You come to a complete stop in the middle of the road and look around./Choice 1: Get to the building on foot/Choice 2: Steal another car/~
You put your car in reverse and speed off in another direction. You look behind you to see if the body is chasing after you. Luckily you see nobody chasing you and sigh in relief. Right as you turn your head around you see that you are going to crash into a car. You slam on your breaks./You were going to fast and could not slow down in time to stop. Your car crashes into the car hard. All you feel is your body fly from your seat and out the windshield.#/~

Before you open your door, you look around to make sure nobody is around. Right as you think you are in the clear, you spot someone walking around. You squint to see if the person is acting normal or if they are rabid. You see the person is holding a shotgun and is walking around with a vest that says "Police" on it. You wait in your car just a little longer to see if he changes his act. The man turns to walk in the other direction. You think to yourself and know that he must be of help because he is patrolling the front entrance. You roll down your window and yell out to him. The man looks over to you./"Do you need help ma'am?"/You yell back that you do./"Okay, come out the vehicle and I will protect you as you run over.", he says./You open your car door and make a run for it. Right as you start to run a zombie comes chasing after you. The police officer points his gun at it and waits till you get closer. You run as fast as you can and get closer to the entrance. The police office yells at you to turn out of his way. You turn and hear a loud noise. The police office shot his gun and killed the zombie. You continue to run over to him./Finally you reach him and thank him for saving your life./"I am glad you made it, go inside and get to safety.", he says./As you walk into the entrance you see many people walking around./"Welcome to the safe zone", says a woman to the left of you.$/~
You open your car and make a run to the front. You hear a scream from behind you and you look back to see a zombie chasing you. You push yourself to run faster to escape. You are so close to the entrance when you trip over your own feet. The zombie reaches you on the floor and grabs your leg. You turn around to stab it with your switch blade and hit it in its chest. The zombie lets go of your leg and lays flat on the cement. You reach to grab your knife and all of a sudden the zombie grabs your arm and bites you. You scream out in pain and feel empty right after.#/~
Before you leave the car you know you can't get to the building without some kind of weapon. You reach into your car compartment and luckily remember you have a switch blade you can use. You find it and keep it in your hand. Before you run out of your car, you look around to see where you can go. From being a pilot, you have many chances to be LA and have had the chance to explore the city very often. You try to remember the location and all the streets around to find the best path. Luckily, you remember there is an ally way close by that will get you to the center quick. You look around and see nobody around. You open your car and make a break for the alley./After running for a couple of minutes, you make it to the alley way. You stop behind a garbage bin and look down the alley. There is a zombie eating a dead body./Choice 1: Find another route/Choice 2: Continue down the alley/~
Before you leave the car you remember you have a switch blade in your car. You grab it and run out of your car quickly. You see one car ahead that has its car door open and you make a break for it./You make it to the car and look for a key to start it. There is nothing there. You exit the car and slam the door. You run to another car close by and try the door. The car doesn't open./You hear a sound come from behind you. You look at the car door window and see a figure running up to you. You turn around and see a zombie coming fast. You quickly run to another car and make it to the handle. You try to pull it open and luckily it does. You jump in and close the door right away. You lock the car door and the zombie slams on the window. You look for the car keys and find them in the ignition. You turn the car on and hear the engine rumble. You notice that the zombie stoped hitting thee window and left. You sigh in relief./Right as you are about to drive off you feel something wet hit the top of your head. You look up to see what it came from and see the zombie staring at you through the open sunroof.#/~

You turn around and run out of the alley. You run down the street taking the other route to get to the center./After running for a minute you run pass a couple of cars and hear sounds coming from them. You pick up your pace and continue to run to the center. Suddenly  you hear footsteps behind you and turn around to look. There is zombie running after you. You turn back around and pick up your pace to try to escape. You prepare your switch blade just in case if they catch up. You hear the zombie beginning to scream and suddenly you see a couple of zombies begin to appear in from of you. You stop running and turn the other way. There are zombies approaching you that way as well. You turn around and make a break for it. Suddenly there are a couple of zombies in front of you in that direction as well. You stand in place and look down at your weapon in your hand. You put it up and prepare for the worst./All the zombies run towards you...#/~
You reach into your pocket to get your switch blade. You look up at the zombie and see that it's still eating the person on the floor. You throw your pocket knife behind you down the alley. The knife hits a car and makes a loud noise. The zombie looks up and runs after the noise. You hide yourself next to the bin and see the zombie pass by you. You get up quickly and run down the alley to continue to the center./As you exit down the alley, you see the center across the street and you make a run for it. You see a police officer at the front entrance and you wave your hand to get his attention. "Help me please!!", you say to him./The police officer looks at you. "Hurry ma'am!", he says./ You run faster and eventually make it to him. He grabs you by the arm and gets you to the front entrance./"You are safe ma'am, go inside and find shelter", he says. You walk in the entrance and know you made it alive.$/~
