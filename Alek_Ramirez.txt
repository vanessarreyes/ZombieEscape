You open up your locker to put away your baseball uniform. Today was a great day, your team won against your biggest rivals, The Bears. You look at your watch and notice it is 4 PM. The rest of the team went out to celebrate after the game while you stayed back to stay in the stadium field to bask in your glory. All of a sudden, you hear loud sirens play./"This is an EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION from the Center for Disease Control. As of this moment, the health crisis in the United States has spread to unsafe levels and a COMPLETE EVACUATION has been ordered. Be cautious of your surroundings and be safe. Avoid contact with others that have been affected. Please evacuate to LAX International Airport as we have contained the area and will be flying survivors to safer locations."/After the notification ends, you know you have to get to safety as soon as possible. You grab your bat and run to the nearest supply closet. In there you find nails and a hammer. With the hammer and nails, you upgrade your bat to prepare yourself with your journey ahead./You exit out of the locker room and find your closest exit out of the building. Outside you don't see anyone around and reach for your car keys in your pocket. You realize they aren't there and begin to search your other pockets frantically. You come to the realization that you forgot them in your locker in the locker room./Choice 1: Run back to go get your car keys/Choice 2: Try to hotwire a car/~
You turn around and run back into the building to go get your car keys. As you walk into the locker room, you approach your locker and open it. You grab your keys that lay at the bottom of the locker. As you are about to walk out of the room you hear a loud bang down the hallway.You rush to the exit and see a figure standing in your way. The figure looks at you and takes a step towards you. The figure has red eyes and blood plastered on its face. You begin to step back and the monster ahead begins to quicken its pace./Choice 1: Fight the zombie ahead/Choice 2: Run away/~
You look at the cars in the parking lot and see your car parked ahead. You rush to the driver's door and cannot open it. You smash the window and reach in to unlock the car. You sit in the driver's seat and look for the panel underneath the steering wheel. As you are about to open the panel, you remember that you have a spare key in the middle compartment. You grab the spare key and start the car. Before you drive off you see two figures in the rear view mirror./"HELP!! PLEASE!"/You see a women running, towards your car. There is a man chasing her. As you look closer at the man you see he looks rabid, he has red eyes and blood stained on his clothes.The two of them are approaching your car quickly./Choice 1: Help the woman/Choice 2: Forget the woman and drive off/~
You stand your ground and ready up your nailed bat. As the monster is close enough, you swing your bat and hit it right in the head. The monster falls to the floor and you stand over the corpse. You examine the body and notice the skin is pale and yellow. The blood on its clothes are freshly stained and the monster looks sick. You realize that this is the virus that the warning was informing everyone about. You grab your bat and run to the exit./The engine of your car starts and you speed off. You know you have to get to LAX airport as soon as you can. The problem is, it's an hour drive from where you are./You have been driving for the last 20 minutes when your gas light goes on in your dashboard. Of course, you forgot to fill up your tank yesterday after practice./You pull up to the nearest gas station and park your car near a gas pump. Before you exit your car, you look around and see that nobody else is around. As you stand in front of the gas pump, you reach for your wallet to grab your credit card to pay for gas. As you insert your card, the gas pump screen prints "See Cashier"./Choice 1: Go see cashier/Choice 2: Try another gas station/~
You turn around and sprint. Luckily you are fast enough to outrun the monster behind you. You turn the corner and run towards the front entrance. The monster is still running after you. You reach the front door and push it open quickly. You reach into your pant pocket and grab your car keys to unlock your car. Once you reach your car door, you quickly open it and jump inside. Right as you slam your door shut, the monster reaches your car door and pounds at the window. You lock your door and rush to start your car. Before you speed off you look at the monster hitting your door. The monster is bitting your window and doing everything it can to get to you. You put your car into drive and slam your foot on the gas pedal. The monster flies off your car and you drive away./Once you are far from the stadium, you begin to question what kind of virus is going around. The thing that was trying to attack you is something you have never seen. It looked like it was something from the movies. Like a zombie. You shake off your crazy thoughts and focus on driving./ As you are driving towards the highway, you see that there are a lot of vacant cars left in the street. You drive close to the side of the road to look at the highway from above and see that there are a couple of people walking around on the highway. You know how to get to the airport through another route, however, the highway may be quicker but is more dangerous./Choice 1: Take the quick but dangerous highway/Choice 2: Take another route/~
You exit out of your car and run over to help the woman. Gripping your nailed bat, you prepare to swing at the man chasing her. As she passes you, you swing your arms and hit the man in the head with your bat. He falls to the floor with your bat stuck in him./The woman turns to you and looks frightened to death. You ask her if she is okay. "Please don't hurt me!!" You put up your hands and tell her that you aren't going to hurt her, you are there to help. "Stay away from me!!" She says as she turns around and runs off./You watch her run off to another car where she slams the window open to get inside. You can see another figure past her car beginning to walk towards the same car. You yell to her to warn her of the man approaching her but it's too late. The person reaches her as she sits in the car and pulls her out of the broken window. The person throws her body on the floor and attacks her. You freak out and run to go grab your nailed bat left in the body of the  monster you killed. You turn around to run to your car when you suddenly make eye contact with the monster that attacked the woman. She's bleeding out on the floor./Choice 1: Make a run to your car/Choice 2: Fight the monster that attacked the woman/~
Being the selfish person you are, you slam on your gas pedal and speed out of the parking lot of the stadium. As you aggressively turn your wheel to exit out of the parking lot, you lose control of your car and flip over, ruining your car./You are covered in glass and have many cuts on your body. You begin to crawl out of your car when you suddenly hear footsteps approach you. You yell for help and reach your hand out./ Someone grips your arm tightly and pulls you out. You look up to see the woman that you left behind. Her eyes were beginning to turn red and you saw she had bite marks on her right shoulder. You try to get up and run but she grabs your leg and bites you./You fell to your weakness of being selfish.#/~
You walk into the gas station and cause the door to ring as you enter in./"SHOW ME YOUR FACE!!!"/You put your hands up and turn your body to where you heard the voice. You look at the woman standing behind the cash register and see that she has a shotgun pointing at you./"Well, you don't have red eyes. What is your name?"/"My name is Alek", you say to the woman./"So you aren't one of those zombies." She says as she puts her weapon down. "That virus that they said is going around, it's causing people to eat each other. I'm lucky I am even alive right now. I had to fight against some of my workers that got bit by strangers walking in. What are you looking for?"/ You explain your journey to her and told her you need gas to get to the airport./"Ya of course. Grab whatever you need to stay alive. I wish I could head over to the airport but I'm waiting for my daughter to get here. She just called me not too long ago and is on her way. Once she gets here I am totally getting out of here."/"Well thank you, I hope your daughter gets here safe and you both can make it to the airport on time", you tell her./You walk out the gas station and go to fill up your gas tank./As you are about done filling up your tank, you see a car pull up to the front of the store. You see a young girl walk out of the car and go into the gas station. You assume it's the cashier's daughter and put the pump back into its place. You get into your car and as soon as you are about to start your engine you hear screaming coming from the gas station./You look over and see the two women run out of the store and rush into the parked car. Right behind them are two zombies. You hear their engine not starting and the zombies beginning to attack their car./Choice 1: Help the two women/Choice 2: Drive off/~
You get back in your car and drive off to another gas station in hopes you have enough gas to get you there./You have been driving for 10 minutes and still have no luck of finding a gas station nearby. Eventually you spot one down the road and speed up. Unfortunately, your car runs out of gas and stops in the middle of the road. You slam on your and punch your steering wheel out of aggravation. When you calm down you look out your window and see a couple bodies stopped in their tracks looking at your car. Your honking must of caught their attention. You freak out and try to start your car to get away. The zombies begin to run towards your car. Your car will not start and cause more attention to yourself just out of trying. Soon there are zombies surrounding your car and pounding on your windows. You grab your bat to prepare to fight when they get in. Finally a zombie breaks the driver's side window and reaches in to grab at you. You swing your bat and injure it. However, there are too many of them to fight off and another zombie reaches in the broken window and reaches in. You feel a hand on your arm and you pull back. Another hand reaches your arm and pulls again. You feel another hand on you and feel yourself being lifted out of the car. You try with all your strength to stay alive but soon feel one of them bite your arm. Your body gets pulled out of the car and soon have multiple zombies feeding off of you.#/~
You drive onto the highway and prepare yourself for what could happen. When you see a person ahead you begin to slow down just in case they aren't dangerous. As you get closer you see that the person has those red eyes and you continue to drive slow hopping it won't try to attack your car. As you are about to slowly pass the monster ahead, it turns its head towards your car and stares at you through the window. You try not to move and still keep your car moving at a slow pace. The monster eventually looks away as it loses interest and you move your gaze to the road in front./Before you could slam on your break in time, your car hits a person. You stop your car and begin to stress out. You don't move your eyes off the hood of your car. You wait to see if the person you hit will get up or not./All of a sudden, the monster you passed slams your window and freaks you out. You slam on your gas pedal and run over the body that you hit. All the monsters ahead turn their heads to your car and begin to chase after you. You continue to speed off and try to avoid all the monsters chasing you. Some of them run into your car as you speed off but you don't stop. Eventually, the road begin to clear and you continue to drive down the highway till you reach your exit./As you get off the exit for the airport, you don't see many cars or people around. Minutes later you reach the airport signs and see that there is a big sign plastered over arrivals that says "Survivor Safe Point". You continue down that path to find the safe point./When you arrive to the entrance of the Safe Point you see people walking around. You can't see their faces from here to tell if they are a threat./Choice 1: Try to sneak past them/Choice 2: Attract their attention/~
You pass up the highway and take a less dangerous path./After driving for a while, you find yourself in a rundown neighborhood. You see people walking around, this time they don't have red eyes. However, they hold guns. When you look down the road you see that they have it blocked off and people guarding the road block./You pull up to the road block and roll down your window. A guard walks up to your side of the car and bends down to talk to you./"Where are you coming from? Nobody from this area gets past this street due to the high threat of obtaining the virus in this neighborhood."/You tell him you are coming from the baseball stadium and that you have not visited any other locations on your way./"I see. Well we need you to get out of the vehicle. We cannot trust anyone and if you are to get past this road block we need to test you."/You ask what they need to test./"We have received information that the sick are indeed weak to a certain medication that we have. We just need to inject you with the medicine and if you don't react you will be able to get to the safe zone."/Choice 1: Go with the guards and take the medicine/Choice 2: Try to rundown the barricade and escape/~
You sprint to your car. You see the monster ahead run after you as well. You reach your car and slip inside and slam the door behind you. You hear the engine still on from when you started the car earlier. You slam your foot on the gas pedal and drive off. You can see the monster continue to chase you as you speed off./You have been driving for a while when you turn on the radio./"This virus out her is mad crazy. Anyone who is out there please stay safe. These people affected are acting like zombies. There are taking bites out to people and spreading the virus. Stay inside peeps and prepare yourself for the apocalypse. If you are one of the brave, try to get to the LAX airport to save yourself. Otherwise, best of luck"/ You turn the station and let music play instead./As you are driving to the airport, you see many people crawling the streets, running to safety. Many people are on the side of the road looking for a ride to safety. You never pull over because you are too afraid to get the virus. After driving for some time, you see someone on the side of the road that looks familiar. The person has one of your team's uniform on. You pull close to get a better look at the person and see it is your teammate Dave. You pull up next to him and call his name./"Hey Alek!! Do you think you could give a ride to the airport./ "What happened to the rest of the team", you asked./"I don't know man. I just remember we were in the bar celebrating and next thing you know there were screams and I just remember passing out. I think I got hit on the head or something, can't remember."/You look at Dave and notice that he has some bloodstains on his uniform but don't see anything else. You ask Dave if he has been in contact with people with red eyes./"I don't know what you're talking about Alek. Like I said I don't remember much, especially whatever happened this last half hour./Choice 1: Let Dave in the car/Choice 2: Drive off/~
You make a move toward the monster ahead. The monster begins to sprint towards you. It screams and makes grunting noises as it moves toward you quickly. You stop walking forward and prepare your bat to hit the zombie ahead. As it comes close enough, you swing your bat and hit the monster right in the head. The body falls on the floor and you look over it in accomplishment. "Shoot I've been on fire today", you say to yourself. You reach down to grab the bat out of the monster's head and walk to your car. You get in your car and throw your bat in the passenger side. You reach to turn on the radio and switch the Chanels till you find the best station. You felt high off being able to beat your rivals today and for beating two monster's trying to kill you. You felt invincible./As you begin to drive off, your driver's side tire pops. You curse to yourself and get out to see what caused the tire to pop. You pick up a nail and realize it came from your bat. You know you have a spare in the back of the car and go to grab it. You pop open the trunk and reach in to grab the tire./All of a sudden you hear a growl from behind you. Your arm is then pulled from the person behind and you quickly turn around. You see that it is the girl that was attacked from the monster you killed. Her eyes were red like the others and you tried to push her off. She caught your other arm as you were about to push her off and she bit it hard. You yell in pain and find yourself weak. You fall against your car and feel her bite your shoulder next. Everything eventually goes black.#/~

You grab your nailed bat and jump out of your car. You stand in front of your car door and prepare your bat to fight./You whistle very loudly to get the zombies's attention. They both turn to you and stop slamming against the woman's car. They stare at you for a quick second and then begin to run after you. You stay prepared to fight them off. When one of them gets close enough you swing your bat and strike one in the head. The body falls to the floor and you quickly raise you bat to swing at the next zombie. Right as you are about to get in position, you get tackled by the zombie and fall to the floor. The zombie chomps at your face but you luckily put your bat up to protect yourself. The zombie scratches at your body and tears skin. You gather your strength and push the zombie off with your bat and quickly rush up. You swing your bat at the zombie laying on the floor and hit it on the neck. The zombie breathes heavy and is gasping for life. You swing your bat again and slam its face in./You drop to the floor, exhausted. You hear the two women open their car doors and run to your side. Before they reach you, the cashier's daughter slams her hand in front of her mother to stop their pace./"What if he got the virus! That zombie hurt him and got to his blood stream!"/You look up at them and out your hands up showing that you aren't bit./"But we can't just leave him here, he saved our lives", said the cashier./"No, we can't trust him", says the daughter./ You see the daughter reach into her back pocket and point a gun to your head./"You freak and plead her to stop./"I'm sorry, I can't risk us becoming one of them"/Then the gun goes off.#/~
You take your eyes of the car that the women are stuck in and start your car. You put it in drive and hesitate to drive off. You realize that you can still help the women by distracting the zombies attacking their car. You put your car in drive and steer close to the car the women are trapped in. You roll your window down and yell at the zombies. They turn to you and stare. You honk your horn and continue to yell. They turn to your car and speed over to attack your car. Before they reach you, you put your car in reverse and have them chase your car. You get the zombies a distance away from the other car and see the women running out. They both pull out guns and begin to shoot the zombies chasing you. You  stop driving and duck down so you don't get hit from their fire aimed your way. Once you hear the shooting stop you lift your head up. The zombies lay on the floor, dead. You drive up to the women and pull over./"Thank you for helping, we thought your were going to drive off.", said the cashier./"No problem. Do you need a ride to safety?", you ask them./"No thanks, I have my car parked around the store that we can take, thank you once again.", said the cashier./You nod your head to them and drive off./After driving for what it seemed forever, you finally arrive to the airport. The drive there was not pleasing as you passed many zombies that you had to try to avoid. You pull up to departures and see nobody around. You park your car and grab your nailed bat as you got out of the car. You see the front entrance and walk in. You walk inside and hear people walking around but don't see anyone. You continue walking when you see a corner coming up. Before you could round the corner, you hear louder footsteps and shadows of figures past the corner./Choice 1: Hide/Choice 2: Prepare your weapon for when they come around the corner/~

You slowly get out of your car, trying as best as you can to not make noise to attract the people outside. With the nailed bat in your hand, you run to find some cover behind a trash can./As you kneel behind the trash can, you see another door to get into the safe zone. No one is around it and it would be a great way to get to safety. You look over at the people walking around in the front and still cannot determine if they are safe or not. You wait till they are looking in a different direction and make a run for the door. However, right as you get up, you accidentally kick a can on the floor and it makes a loud noise. You look over at the people and see they begin to look at you. You make a run for the door./"Hey we have an infected trying to get in!!", you hear one of them say./You begin to slow your pace and look over to tell them you are not a threat./Gun shots blast off in your direction and you feel pain in your body. You fall to the floor.#/~
You look around in your car to find something you could throw to make noise. Luckily, you find a baseball laying in a gym bag in the back seat. You open your door slowly and throw the ball to hit a trash can not too far away. The ball slams right into the trash can and makes a loud noise./"What was that!!, one of the people at the entrance say./You see that the people in front of the entrance pull out their weapons and aim it towards the trash can you hit. You can hear them talk but can't exactly understand what they are saying./From the encounters you have had, these people don't look effected. You get out of your car and put your hands up./"Please help! I am here for the safe zone!", you say./The men look your way and point their weapons./"Walk over slowly so we can help!", they yell to you./You walk over slowly to make sure that you don't make any mistakes. Once you get close to the people at the door they tell you to show them your eyes. You look at them and they tell you that you are safe and to rush inside./When you are inside one of the people from outside follow you in./"Welcome to the safe zone. We are glad you were able to make it.$/~
You enter a room that has all kinds of needles and medicine around./"Please sit", says a man in a lab coat./You sit down in the chair in the middle of the room./"We are going to inject a medicine that we think to be the cure to this infection. It will sting a little but if you aren't affected then you will survive, otherwise you will die.", says the man in the lab coat. Before you could object, the man injects you with the cure. "What is in the cure may I ask", you say./"Nothing too much, we made it from other medicines and added a certain herb.", says the man in the lab coat./You ask the man what herb it is./"It is mint that we added.", says the man in the lab coat./You freak out and rise out of your chair./"Sir calm down, you are fine. From what I can tell you aren't affected since you haven't died yet. We will let you go soon.", says the man in the lab coat./"You don't understand, I am allergic to mint! I need to get it out of my body or I will die!!", you yell at him./"Oh gosh, stay calm we must have something around here to help you.", says the man in the lab coat./You see him turn around and search frantically. You begin to feel your throat tighten and find breathing to be harder. You try to yell for help but the mint is affecting your body too quickly. You soon can't breathe and feel yourself gasping for air./The man in the lab coat turns around and sees your body laying still on the chair, medicine in his hand to help you but it's too late./You're weakness of allergies killed you.#/~
You slam on your gas pedal to break down the barrier. The men begin to shoot at your car and you duck your head down to protect yourself. You feel your car slam through the barrier ahead. You speed off to get away./After escaping from the men shooting at you, you find yourself getting close to the safe zone./You soon arrive to the airport and drive to the departure zone of the airport. When you arrive you see other cars parked outside. You pull up and park your car. When you look around you don't see anyone around. You roll down your window and look out. You can see some movement inside the building and take your chance. You get out of your car and run inside with your nailed bat in hand. As soon as you reach the front entrance someone walks out./"Put your hands up! NOW!"/You throw your hands up and look at the person./"Say your name so I know you are safe!"/You tell the man your name and he lowers his weapon./"You are safe. Come on in, you are one of the lucky ones."/You walk in and see people walking around./"Welcome to the safe zone."$/~
You tell Dave to get in. He gets in the car and you speed off./"Thank you man. I did not have anywhere to go."/You ignore him and focus on driving to the airport./After driving for some time, you hear Dave coughing loudly. You look over at him and ask if he is okay. He doesn't reply and continues to cough in his hand. He lifts his head from his hand and you see that there is blood all on his hand. "Dave talk to me are you good?", you tell him./There is still no reply from Dave and you put your eyes back on the road. Soon you hear Dave groaning and making weird noises. You pull over and park your car./You look over at Dave and push him lightly to get his attention. "Dave say something, what the hell is up with you.", you say. He looks up to you and you can see that he looks horrible. Then you see his eyes and they are turning red./"Dave get out of here!", you yell as you push him to the door./He pushes you back and you slam into your door. You reach to your door handle to get out. Before you could jump out you feel Dave grab your shoulder and pull you back. Dave slams his mouth onto your neck and bites down hard. You scream out in pain and try to fight him off but you are too weak. Everything begins to turn dark.#/~
You look at Dave one more time and decide to tell him to go away./"Come on Dave please, I'm your teammate. Don't be a you know what.", Dave says./You turn your head to the front of the road and drive off. You look in your rearview mirror and see Dave disappear from sight./You eventually get to the airport and park in the parking lot outside of the arrivals. You look around and see nobody around. You grab your nailed bat and open your door to get to the entrance. You get out of your car and accidentally slam your door shut. You hear a growl come from a distance and you begin to run./The zombie soon appears and starts to chase after you to the entrance. You speed close to the entrance and begin to yell for help. The door in front of you opens and you see a man pop his head out. You continue to yell for help and the man pulls out his gun and aims it your way./"Move out the way before I shoot you!", the man yells./You jump to the floor and cover your head as you hear a gun shoot off. You look behind you and see the zombie lay on the floor. You rush top and run over to the man in the door./"Luckily you scream so loud I was able to save you. Come inside, you made it the safe zone.", the man says.#/~

You look around to find somewhere to hide. You see a trash bin large enough to cover behind. You run to hide behind it./The people walk past you and the bin and you get up to run where they came from. As you are getting up, you accidentally push the can over and it makes a loud thud. The men turn back to you and point their weapons to you. You look up at them and put your hands up./"State tour name!", one of them says./You look at them in fear and as you are about to speak up you begin to cough./"He's infected! SHOOT HIM", one of them says./You begin to talk but it's too late. They fire off their weapons.#/~
You yell out help in hopes that they are not one of the effected. You hear footsteps approach you and see the people walk around the corner. They have their guns pointing at you./"Oh good you are alive. We thought you were being attacked. Come with us, you're safe now.", one of them says./After following the men they walk you to a large room where you see other people walking around. You made it to the safe zone.$/~
